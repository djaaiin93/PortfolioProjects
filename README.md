## [Predicting Absenteeism from work](./Absenteeism.md)

This project focuses on predicting absenteeism from work by leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques.  
The objective is to explore whether specific known reasons for absence can serve as indicators of excessive absenteeism.

The dataset, initially containing information such as transportation expense, distance to work, age, and reason for absence, undergoes thorough preprocessing and feature engineering.  
The key steps involve encoding reasons for absence, extracting temporal features, and creating a target variable indicating excessive absenteeism.  
A logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed data, and its performance is evaluated.  
The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing absenteeism, ultimately contributing to a more informed and predictive approach to workforce management.  
The resulting model and associated scaler are saved for future use, enabling the seamless application of the predictive model to new data.
