# Project Title: Analyzing Coffee Sales - Excel Dashboard

## Introduction
In this project, I delved into the world of coffee sales, leveraging Excel's functionalities to derive insights and visualize trends from a comprehensive dataset. By importing and manipulating data, creating pivot tables, and designing a dashboard, I aimed to uncover patterns and key factors influencing coffee sales.

## Dataset Import and Data Preparation
I started by importing a dataset into Excel, containing information about orders, customers, products, and sales. Using Excel functions like XLOOKUP and INDEX, I integrated data from customers and product tables into the orders table, creating a consolidated view for analysis. This process ensured a cohesive dataset for further exploration.

## Data Quality Check and Visualization
I conducted a thorough check for duplicates within the dataset, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. Moving to visualization, I employed Excel's powerful pivot tables to generate meaningful insights:

1. **Year and Month vs. Coffee Type Sales:**  
   I prepared pivot tables showcasing sales trends based on different coffee types over months and years, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of seasonal variations and popularity trends.

2. **Country and Roast Type vs. Sales:**  
   Another pivot table visualized sales based on the country of purchase and the type of roast, providing insights into regional preferences and roast popularity.

3. **Loyalty Card and Size vs. Average Sales:**  
   A pivot table highlighted the relationship between loyalty card usage, coffee size, and average sales, offering insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## [Dashboard Creation]
I synthesized these insightful visualizations into a comprehensive Excel dashboard:

- **Visual Appeal:** Formatted the visuals to enhance readability and visual appeal, employing color schemes and appropriate formatting techniques.
- **Interactive Elements:** Integrated filters using timelines for order dates and slicers for coffee size, roast type, country, and loyalty card status. These interactive elements allowed for dynamic exploration of data subsets.
- **Data Storytelling:** Crafted the dashboard to tell a coherent story, allowing stakeholders to seamlessly navigate through different aspects of coffee sales, from temporal trends to customer preferences.

## Conclusion
This Excel dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to grasp nuanced insights into coffee sales. By visually representing sales trends, regional preferences, and customer behavior, it enables data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer engagement initiatives in the coffee business. The project's use of Excel's functionalities demonstrates the potential for leveraging familiar tools to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
